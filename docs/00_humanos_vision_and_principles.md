## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 The core problem

Modern humans live inside a fragmented digital environment:

- Dozens of disconnected apps for tasks, calendar, chat, notes, health, money, and content.
- Constant overload: notifications, feeds, obligations, information.
- No single place that holds a **coherent picture** of the person, their life, and their priorities.
- Algorithms often optimized for **engagement and profit**, not for **wellbeing and clarity**.

As a result, people are:

- Managing their lives reactively instead of intentionally.
- Spending more time organizing tools than actually living.
- Feeling emotionally and cognitively exhausted.

### 1.2 HumanOS mission

> **HumanOS exists to give every person a clear life map, a trustworthy co-pilot, and a humane ecosystem to grow in.**

Concretely, HumanOS aims to:

1. **Model the person and their life as a coherent system**, not as separate “work”, “health”, “money” or “social” silos.
2. **Transform vague desires into realistic, actionable plans**, day by day and week by week.
3. **Coordinate digital tools and services around the human**, rather than forcing the human to constantly jump between tools.
4. **Host an ecosystem of experts, creators, and services** that are aligned with human wellbeing, not with exploitation.

The long-term outcome:  
People use HumanOS as their **Digital Life Operating System** – the “home base” where they understand themselves, design their lives, and connect with the right help when needed.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 What HumanOS *is*

HumanOS is:

1. **Life OS (Life Model + Engine)**  
   A structured representation of a person’s life: their values, roles, goals, projects, habits, constraints, emotional state, and environment.

2. **Super-App Shell (Orchestration Layer)**  
   A single interface that sits above other tools (calendar, task managers, file storage, health trackers, messaging, socials) and coordinates them through integrations and automation.

3. **AI Co-Pilot Layer (Multi-Agent System)**  
   A set of specialized AI agents that:
   - Understand the user’s long-term directions and current reality.
   - Help design strategies and plans.
   - Adjust these plans as life changes.
   - Communicate in a human-friendly, transparent way.

4. **Ecosystem & Marketplace**  
   A curated environment where:
   - Individuals can access programs, sessions, and products.
   - Coaches, therapists, mentors, teachers, and creators can offer services and structured journeys.
   - Transactions, reputation, and feedback are managed in a way that protects users and rewards real value.

### 2.2 What HumanOS is *not*

HumanOS is **not**:

- A replacement for:
  - Licensed medical professionals or psychotherapists.
  - Certified financial advisors.
  - Lawyers or legal counsel.
- A dopamine-driven social network optimized for:
  - Addictive feeds.
  - Vanity metrics.
  - Outrage, polarization, or clickbait.
- An advertising network built on:
  - Selling detailed personal data.
  - Manipulative targeting or hidden scoring.

Where professional expertise is needed, HumanOS **supports and augments** real humans; it does not try to impersonate or replace them.

---

## 3. Levels of Operation

HumanOS is designed as a multi-level system. The same engine (goals, projects, habits, workflows, data) can operate at different scales:

1. **Self Space**  
   - One individual: identity, psychology, roles, routines, life areas.
   - Primary focus for early versions.

2. **Relationship Spaces (1:1)**  
   - Pairs: romantic partners, friends, parent–child, mentor–mentee.
   - Shared rituals, shared goals, communication hygiene, conflict-repair tools.

3. **Family Space**  
   - Household: shared calendar, responsibilities, finances, health, logistics.

4. **Team / Crew Space**  
   - Small teams: creative crews, startup teams, student project groups.
   - Focus on projects, roles, accountability, and collective rituals.

5. **Organization Space**  
   - Companies or institutions that use HumanOS:
     - As a wellbeing and productivity support layer.
     - With strict privacy separation between personal and organizational data.

6. **Community / Guild Space**  
   - Communities organized around a craft or interest:
     - Writers, musicians, filmmakers, developers, educators, etc.
   - Shared challenges, curated resources, co-learning programs.

7. **World / Planet View (Symbolic & Aggregated)**  
   - Anonymous, aggregated indicators (never personally identifiable) about:
     - Stress patterns, sleep habits, work–life balance, burnout risk.
   - Purpose:
     - Better design of tools and programs.
     - Potential collaboration with researchers or NGOs in the future.

### 3.1 Current implementation scope

In early versions (v0.x / v1.x):

- Focus is on:
  - **Self Space** as the main experience.
  - Light versions of:
    - Relationship spaces.
    - Small team spaces.
- Higher levels (Organization, Community, World) are **designed conceptually** and will be implemented in later phases, once the core engine is stable.

## 5. Experience Principles (Human-First Product Design)

These principles govern user experience, interface design, and interaction patterns.

### 5.1 Human before features

- Every screen must be justified by:
  > “What is the smallest genuinely helpful thing for this person right now?”
- We prefer fewer, deeper features over many shallow ones.
- The internal complexity of the engine must not leak to the user.

### 5.2 Progressive depth, not overload

- Onboarding starts simple:
  - A short flow that builds an initial life map and first-week plan.
- Depth is unlocked over time:
  - Advanced assessments, domains, and tools appear only when the user is ready or explicitly asks.
- The product should feel:
  - Welcoming on day one.
  - Deeply powerful after months of use.

### 5.3 Respect for energy, time, and attention

- No infinite, meaningless feeds.
- Notifications:
  - Are minimal, intentional, and user-configurable.
  - Emphasize commitments, health, and reflection—not fear or urgency.
- The interface supports:
  - Focus (clear what to do now).
  - Closure (clear when something is done).
  - Rest (encouraging breaks and time away from screens).

### 5.4 Honest, grounded language

- Tone: clear, respectful, empathetic, non-patronizing.
- No:
  - Fake pep-talk.
  - Toxic positivity.
  - Shaming users for “failing”.
- The system acknowledges:
  - Ambivalence.
  - Setbacks.
  - The non-linear nature of real change.

### 5.5 Inclusive and flexible

- HumanOS must respect:
  - Different cultures, languages, and worldviews.
  - Different abilities and neurotypes.
- Wherever possible:
  - UI should be accessible (contrast, fonts, motion control, keyboard navigation).
  - Life assumptions (9-to-5 job, traditional family, etc.) must not be hard-coded.

### 5.6 Exportability and agency

- Users should feel they can:
  - Leave at any time.
  - Export their data.
  - Use HumanOS as a tool, not a prison.
- This shapes:
  - Data formats.
  - Design of imports/exports.
  - Overall trust relationship.

---

## 6. AI Principles

HumanOS is AI-centric, but AI is **bounded by clear rules**.

### 6.1 Main roles of AI in HumanOS

- Understanding:
  - Parse unstructured input (journal entries, voice notes) into structured insights and tasks.
- Planning:
  - Co-design strategies, plans, and routines that respect constraints.
- Reflection:
  - Mirror patterns (“you seem to be overcommitted every Monday”) without judgment.
- Guidance:
  - Suggest choices, not commands.
  - Offer alternatives with pros/cons where relevant.

### 6.2 Hard boundaries

AI within HumanOS:

- **Does not**:
  - Diagnose mental disorders.
  - Prescribe medication or treatment protocols.
  - Provide personalized investment, tax, or legal advice.
  - Present itself as a human therapist, doctor, lawyer, or financial advisor.
- **Does**:
  - Offer general psycho-education and best practices.
  - Encourage contact with professionals when red flags appear.
  - Help users prepare for real sessions (e.g., list questions to ask a therapist).

### 6.3 Transparency and explainability

- AI suggestions should:
  - Identify which data they are based on (e.g., sleep logs, journal tags, work hours).
  - Indicate uncertainty where applicable.
- Users can:
  - Ask “Why?” and get a human-readable explanation.
  - Inspect and adjust their profile and assumptions used by agents.

### 6.4 Non-manipulation

- AI may **not**:
  - Exploit fear, guilt, or shame to drive engagement or sales.
  - Hide commercial interests behind “neutral recommendations”.
- If a suggestion includes a paid option:
  - It must be clearly labelled as such.
  - Alternatives (including free paths) should be offered when reasonable.

### 6.5 Human override

- Users are always in control:
  - Can mute agents.
  - Can opt out of certain AI behaviors.
  - Can delete or redact specific data from being used by AI.

## 7. Data, Privacy & Safety

### 7.1 Data ownership

- Users own their personal data.  
  HumanOS acts as a processor and steward.
- Users must be able to:
  - Export data in standard formats.
  - Delete accounts and data (subject to legal retention requirements).
  - Control which data is:
    - Local only.
    - Synced to the cloud.
    - Shared with providers within the ecosystem.

### 7.2 Data minimization

- We collect only what is reasonably needed to deliver value.
- Sensitive fields (trauma history, mental health details, intimate relationship issues) are:
  - Optional.
  - Clearly labelled.
  - Subject to stronger protections and less processing.

### 7.3 Security

Baseline expectations:

- Encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest where feasible.
- Strict separation between:
  - Authentication/identity data.
  - Life content data (journals, plans, logs).
  - Operational logs/analytics (minimized and anonymized where possible).
- Regular security reviews and sane defaults.

### 7.4 No exploitative use of data

HumanOS will not:

- Sell identifiable personal data to advertisers or data brokers.
- Create hidden “risk scores” that can be used externally (e.g., by banks, insurers, employers).
- Use sensitive life data to manipulate users into spending or engagement.

### 7.5 Crisis handling

- If content indicates imminent risk (self-harm, severe abuse, danger):
  - The system responds with:
    - Supportive, non-judgmental language.
    - Clear suggestions to contact hotlines, professionals, or trusted people.
  - Any more advanced response (e.g., optional sharing with a trusted contact) must be:
    - Explicit.
    - Opt-in.
    - Transparent.

## 8. Ecosystem & Economic Model

### 8.1 Roles

The ecosystem includes:

- **Individuals (core users)** – using HumanOS for their own lives.
- **Creators** – publishing content, tools, templates, and workflows.
- **Service providers** – coaches, therapists, consultants, teachers, mentors.
- **Product sellers** – offering digital products (and later selected physical products).
- **Affiliates / promoters** – people who recommend programs or products and earn a share.

### 8.2 Alignment and fairness

Money flows should:

- Reward:
  - Genuine value and outcomes.
  - Long-term relationships.
- Avoid:
  - Short-term exploitation.
  - Hidden fees and lock-ins.

Example models:

- Subscriptions for core HumanOS features (with free tier where possible).
- Revenue share for:
  - Programs and services sold through the platform.
- Transparent fees and terms for both providers and users.

### 8.3 Reputation and trust

- Providers and creators have:
  - Verified profiles (where relevant).
  - Ratings and reviews.
- Reviews must:
  - Include context (what service, duration, goals).
  - Be protected against obvious abuse (spam, revenge, bots).
- Users can:
  - Report harmful or unethical behavior.
  - See clear guidelines on what is and isn’t allowed.

---

## 9. Red Lines (“Never Do” List)

HumanOS commits to **never**:

1. Become an attention casino built on addictive feeds and vanity metrics.
2. Sell or trade personally identifiable life data to third-party advertisers or data brokers.
3. Use dark patterns to:
   - Trap users in subscriptions.
   - Make it difficult to leave, cancel, or export data.
4. Present AI guidance as clinical, legal, or financial authority.
5. Pretend that AI-only interaction is a full substitute for real human care.
6. Push users towards a single ideology or lifestyle as “the correct way to live”.
7. Penalize or limit features for users who choose strict privacy (e.g., less data sharing).

These red lines are **product constraints**, not marketing slogans.
